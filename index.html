      <h5>Quotes from Sergey Brin Himself</h5>
      <pre>
        <p>-"Basically, we convert the entire Web into a big equation,
      with several hundred million variables,
      which are the page ranks of all the Web pages, and billions of terms,
      which are the links. And we're able to solve that equation."
      -Sergey Brin
      <br>
      -"I had no dreams of such economic success.
      You should have fun and not be so weighed down by expectations."-Sergey Brin
      <br>
      -"The kind of environment that we developed Google in,
      the reason that we were able to develop a search engine,
      is the web was so open. Once you get too many rules,
      that will stifle innovation."
      -Sergey Brin
      <br>
      -"Obviously everyone wants to be successful,
      but I want to be looked back on as being very innovative,
      very trusted and ethical and ultimately making a big difference in the world."
      -Sergey Brin
      <br>
      -"I was interested in data mining,
      which means analyzing large amounts of data,
      discovering patterns and trends. At the same time,
      Larry started downloading the Web,
      which turns out to be the most interesting data you can possibly mine."
